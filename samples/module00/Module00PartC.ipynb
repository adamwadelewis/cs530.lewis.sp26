    "# Formatted Output\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing fancy output formatting in Python is one of the strengths of the language.   It's also one of the confusing points as well the formatting functions have evolved over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to note is that, unlike C++, reading data from the keyboard and writing to display uses a different programming interface than what you use with files.\n",

    "## Formatted String Literals\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3.x supports *interpolated* string literals: a way to note include variables and literals with a string literal whose values fill the placeholder within the string literal.     One indicates that you are doing a formatted string literal by pre-pending either a `f` or `F` before the opening quotation mark or triple quote.    Inside the string you can write a Python expression inside a pair of braces that can refer to variables or literal values."
