    "The choice of programming language is a subjective decision that is best\n",

You will note that we're working in a Juypter Notebook for these lectures,  which is a \"cell-based IDE\" which allows you mix text, graphics, and executable code in a single document.   The executable code is implemented by having code cells serve as a front-end to the Python REPL interpreter.\n",

    "- Note the use of the `name-main` idiom\n",
    "  - Python does not have a `main()` function like the C++ entry point\n",
    "  - Instead the Python interpreter assumes that all things in your Python file are items to be executed on the \"main\" thread of execution\n",
